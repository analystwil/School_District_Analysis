# School_District_Analysis

# Overview


The purpose is to provide Maria an analysis on the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. The school board made Maria aware that the current data in the spreadsheet may show evidence of academic dishonestly so they would like to take a deeper dive into the data to see what exactly happened. I have replaced both scores (reading, math) with the NaN value. The analysis will include data before and after the review of academic dishonesty. 


# District Summary Analysis:
